# Omega-Homeless-Plugin

A plug-in for homeless roleplay, Trashing diving.
The plugin handles the process based on props, CDs can be set, separate item lists can be congigured for prop lists. Items have a drop chance. 
Some example items are uploaded to the plugin. The configuration of these items can be unique for everyone. The plugin does not create the items.
The plugin is still under development. All ideas, advice and improvements are welcome.
